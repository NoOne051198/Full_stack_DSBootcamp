    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ `shutil.copy()` method is used to copy the contents of a `file from one file to another file/folder`, it primary takes two arguments src and dest, __source__ represents the file to be copied where as __destination__ refers to the file/folder to where the src data should be copied, if dest is a folder name the src with exact name will be copied to the dest folder, if its a file then the contents of src will be copied to dest where dest retains it name.\n",
    "\n",
    "`shutil.copytree()` function is used to copy the entire contents of a `folder to other folder`. it also takes two arguments src & dest, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. the important catch here is __destination must not exist prior to this__ and it will be created during the copy operation_."

    "\n",
    "__Ans:__ `Shutil` module provides a funciton named as `shutil.rmtree()` which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are os.remove() -> removes a file, os.rmdir() removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as `send2trash` module provides a function called `send2trash.send2trash()` to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder, if is deleted using the send2trash.send2trash() function. send2trash is not included with python standard libary like os & shutil modules. it needs to be installed explicitly using the command `!pip install send2trash`"
